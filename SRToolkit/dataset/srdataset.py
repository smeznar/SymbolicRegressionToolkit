            X: The input data to be used in parameter estimation for variables. We assume that X is a 2D array
                with shape (n_samples, n_features).
            y: The target values to be used in parameter estimation.
            ground_truth: The ground truth expression, represented as a list of tokens (strings) in the infix notation.
            original_equation: The original equation from which the ground truth expression was generated).
            symbols: The symbol library to use.
            max_evaluations: The maximum number of expressions to evaluate. Less than 0 means no limit.
            max_expression_length: The maximum length of the expression. Less than 0 means no limit.
            max_constants: The maximum number of constants allowed in the expression. Less than 0 means no limit.
            success_threshold: The RMSE threshold below which the experiment is considered successful.
            constant_range: A list of two floats, specifying the lower and upper bounds for the constant values.
                Default is [-5.0, 5.0]. If constant_range is None, we automatically set it to [-5.0, 5.0]
